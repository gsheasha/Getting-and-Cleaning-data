## Project Description


##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
####For each record it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
Description on how to create the tidy data file 
1. download the data
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This tidy data can be reproduced if the following script is run and SamSung data is in your working directory.

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
  180 rows and 88 columns
 - Summary of the data
 This dataset includes average estimated means and average standard deviation of the measurements for every one of the 30 participants in every activity of the 6 activities in the study. 
 - Variables present in the dataset

###subject
Factor
No unit of Measurement
Ranges from 1 to 30
It refers to number of the participant

###activity
Factor
1. LAYING
2. SITTING
3. STANDING
4. WALKING
5. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
6. WALKING_UPSTAIRS

###Regarding variables from the third to the 88th:
####Names of the variables
Their names follow the scheme shown below
Their name is composed of eight parts:
1. angle: it refers to the signals averaged in a signal window sample.
2. t or f:  t refers to time domain signals
            f refers to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) application
3. body or gravity: body refers to body acceleration signals
                    gravity refers to gravity acceleration signals
4. acc or gyro: acc refers to signals come from accelerometer
                gyro refers to signals come from gyroscope
5. mean or std: mean refers to the mean for the associated signals
                std refers to the standard deviation of the associated signals
6.jerk: jerk refers to Jerk signals derived from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity
7. mag: refers to the magnitude of Jerk signals calculated using the Euclidean norm 
8. x, y or z: x refers to axial signals taken in x direction
              y refers to axial signals taken in y direction
              z refers to axial signals taken in z direction

For example,
tbodyaccmeanx refers to the mean of body signals in the x direction taken by the accelerator
####Class:
They are all numeric
####Values:
Their values represent the mean for every variable for each activity for each subject 
####Unit of measurement
They are normalized values and bounded with in [-1,1]
